# EVP
Easy Vehicle Parking System (EVP) aims to simplify and automate the process of vehicle parking management. This system likely provides efficient solutions for tracking available parking slots, managing vehicle entries and exits, and possibly includes features like real-time parking space updates and online reservations. The goal of EVP would be to improve user convenience, reduce manual effort in managing parking spaces, and optimize the overall parking experience for both users and administrators.
